# CE218-Asteroids
First taught game development module in which we created an Asteroids game in Java

I'm pretty proud of this game, although from a 'Game Design' element, there's not enough in here to keep a player interested past maybe half a level or past the first level. The game used procedural content generation for enemy spawners, asteroid spawners, asteroid shapes, and features a 2.5d element with world wrap and parallaxing stars/background which makes it very pretty to look at IMHO for a second year student. The music is the only content I did not make in this game, so all textures and backgrounds done by hand.

We were introduced to some interesting concepts, such as AI controller behaviour, Q-learning, and typical game programming designs. For 2-3 months, alongside a week in hospital, I think this came out quite well, got 87% for it.
